# Notes and Examples from Introducing Python by Bill Lubanovic
## Part 1. Python Basics
### Chapter 1. A Taste of Py
- Python is a good general-purpose, high-level language. It's design make it very *readable*.

### Chapter 2. Data: Types, Values, Variables, and Names
- Python is *strongly typed*, which means that the type of an object does not change, even if its value is mutable

### Chapter 3. Numbers
- In Python, the expressino on the right side of the = is calculated first, and then assigned to the variable on the left side
- You can express literal integers in three bases besides decimal with these integer prefixes:
  - `0b` or `0B` for *binary* (base 2)
  - `0o` or `0O` for *octal* (base 8)
  - `0x` or `0X` for *hex* (base 16)
